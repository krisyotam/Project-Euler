# Project Euler Solutions in Common Lisp

This repository contains solutions to various Project Euler problems implemented in Common Lisp. The focus is on achieving both efficiency and clarity, with solutions designed to be fast and clean.

I aim to track and improve my solutions over time, ensuring they are not only correct but optimized for performance. The solutions provided are crafted to demonstrate effective use of Common Lisp for problem-solving.

# Format

Each solution is placed in its own file, named euler-n.lisp, where n corresponds to the problem number. Each file contains a single function of the same name that takes no arguments and returns an integer representing the answer to the problem.

Functions useful across multiple problems are included in common.lisp. I am not using packages to keep the setup simple, as the package declaration would typically be larger than the solutions themselves.
